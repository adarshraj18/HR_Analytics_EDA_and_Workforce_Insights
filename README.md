**Dataset Features:**  
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education Field, Marital Status.  
- **Job Attributes:** Department, Job Role, Tenure, Training Hours, Performance Ratings.  
- **Compensation:** Monthly Income, Bonus Eligibility, Pay Grades.

## **1. Objective**  
1. Identify **drivers of attrition** across departments, roles, and demographics.  
2. Analyze **workforce composition and diversity**.  
3. Evaluate **salary distribution and performance trends**.  
4. Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to support **data-driven HR decision-making**.

## **2. Approach & Methodology**  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
  - Standardized categorical fields (Departments, Job Roles).  
  - Handled missing salary and training hour values.  
  - Created calculated columns for Age Groups and Tenure Buckets.  

- **Power BI Data Modeling:**  
  - Built relationships between fact and dimension tables.  
  - Created **DAX measures** for KPIs:  
    - Attrition Rate  
    - Average Salary by Role  
    - Diversity Index  
    - Training Hours vs Performance Correlation  

- **Visualization Design:**  
  - **Employee Overview Page:** Workforce composition, gender ratio, average tenure.  
  - **Attrition Analysis Page:** Attrition by Department, Role, Age Group, and Tenure.  
  - **Performance & Compensation Page:** Salary distribution, bonus eligibility, and training effectiveness.

## **3. Key Insights & Findings**  

### **3.1 Attrition Drivers**  
- **Sales roles** and **mid-tenure employees (3â€“5 years)** show the highest attrition rates (~28%).  
- Employees with **less training exposure** (<20 hours/year) had **1.5x higher attrition**.  

### **3.2 Performance & Compensation**  
- **Performance ratings correlate strongly with salary progression**; top performers earn ~30% more than average performers.  
- **Bonus eligibility** reduces attrition by ~12%, suggesting financial incentives improve retention.

### **3.3 Workforce Composition**  
- Gender diversity stands at **40% Female, 60% Male**; however, **leadership roles are 75% Male**.  
- Average employee tenure is **4.3 years**, with **R&D roles** having the longest tenure.
